# Hey, Welcome!

I'm a Computer Science student crafting cool stuff with code. Here's what I tinker with:

- **Java**: Building sturdy apps with swagger.
- **C**: Low-level wizardry for the soul.
- **Go**: Speedy solutions for modern problems.
- **PHP**: The trusty tool for web magic.
- **Python**: Scripting, automating, and solving problems with flair.
- **Linux**: My command-line dojo.

## Projects I'm Proud Of
